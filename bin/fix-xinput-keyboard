# Works around a stupid flaw with my keyboard where the "System Control" device seems to repeatedly
# send the Sleep keycode, or for whatever reason xinput thinks it's repeatedly receiving that
# keycode. It starts happening at random and usually requires disconnecting and reconnecting the
# wireless receiver. I run this as a cron every 5 minutes so the device is disabled before it
# becomes a problem. Only works when using Xorg, but it doesn't seem to be an issue on Wayland.
